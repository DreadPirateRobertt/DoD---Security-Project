Maintaining the security of our networks is a high priority at DoD. Our information technologies provide critical services to Service Members, their families, and DoD employees and contractors. Ultimately, our network security ensures that DoD can defend the United States of America. Recognizing that the broader security research community regularly makes valuable contributions to the security of the Internet, DoD believes that a close relationship with this community will also improve our security. As a result, if you have information about a vulnerability, we want to hear from you!

First, any information submitted to the DoD under this program will be used for defensive purposes – to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities in our networks or applications, or in the applications of our vendors. This research is not contributing to offensive tools or capabilities.

Second, the VDP program is part of DoD’s efforts to host a conversation between outside security researchers and the Department. This discussion is already underway and as of September 2020, security researchers have identified more than 24,000 potential exploits for our public facing systems. This new program broadens this exchange by offering additional terms and conditions on publicly accessible information system and reporting vulnerabilities – all as part of the effort to improve security over time.
